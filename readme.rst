TicTacToe multiplayer
=====================

1. The solution based on Crossbar.io, Twisted, Autobahn and classical TicTacToe game.

2. In order to start project just launch run.sh.

3. To join a match follow: http://178.62.226.23:8080/index.html
You will get some messages and most likely will successfully join a match.
DO NOT refresh a page please.

4. The second player should do the same.

5. You can play! "X" turns first. You can see some details in browser console.

6. After a match finished you should reload the page to establish a connection.

7. If something goes wrong(you can not join a match, you reload a page accidentally...) just restart a server.
The solution is just a demo not for production yet.
